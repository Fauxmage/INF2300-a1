"""
This class is responsible for handling a request. The whole class is
handed over as a parameter to the server instance so that it is capable
of processing request. The server will use the handle-method to do this.
It is instantiated once for each request!
Since it inherits from the StreamRequestHandler class, it has two very
usefull attributes you can use:

rfile - This is the whole content of the request, displayed as a python
file-like object. This means we can do readline(), readlines() on it!

wfile - This is a file-like object which represents the response. We can
write to it with write(). When we do wfile.close(), the response is
automatically sent.

The class has three important methods:
handle() - is called to handle each request.
setup() - Does nothing by default, but can be used to do any initial
tasks before handling a request. Is automatically called before handle().
finish() - Does nothing by default, but is called after handle() to do any
necessary clean up after a request is handled.
